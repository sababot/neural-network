# neural-network
a fully-functional neural network implemented from scratch in C++ using the Eigen Matrix library. most neural networks are implemented in python and their really aren't much neural networks implemented from scratch in c++. i chose to use c++ as despite it being harder to program due to limited information, the network would perform much faster and would be more efficient.

# datasets
when building the network, we will be using an insignificant dataset, the spiral dataset, to test our neural network. when the network finishes completion, we will use a real-world dataset to see how it performs.
